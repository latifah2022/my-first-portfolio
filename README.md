An employer can view my portfolio of my work samples and assess whether am a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs:

Presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

THEN I am taken to that deployed applicatioN

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
